Jaws NES Disassembly
====================

This is a project to document the Jaws NES game code.

To build the project you will need:
 - The CC65 development tools (https://cc65.github.io/)
 - An original NES Jaws rom placed in this folder, named "original.nes"
 - GNU Make

Then run `make`, if everything works you can then play `main.nes`.

Left to document
----------------

Much of the game has been documented, there are some missing bits specifically in the sound system and some more cleaning up to do.

Hope you find this interesting!
