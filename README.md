Jaws NES Disassembly
====================

This is a project to document the Jaws NES game code.

To build the project you will need:
 - The CC65 development tools (https://cc65.github.io/)
 - An original NES Jaws rom placed in this folder, named "original.nes"
 - GNU Make

Then run `make`, if everything works you can then play `main.nes`.

Left to document
----------------

Mostly complete at this point, some parts of the entities could be named better.

And probably more commenting is in order and cleaning up the formatting.

Hope you find this interesting!
