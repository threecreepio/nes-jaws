Jaws NES Disassembly
====================

This is a project to document the Jaws NES game code.

To build the project you will need:
 - The CC65 development tools (https://cc65.github.io/)
 - An original NES Jaws rom placed in this folder, named "original.nes"
 - GNU Make

Then run `make`, if everything works you can then play `main.nes`.

Left to document
----------------

Much of the game has been documented, the main remaining areas are:

 - Sound system
 - Finale screen needs cleaning up

On top of this it would be nice to provide aliases for things like flags used differently by different enemy types.

Also could use a little style cleanup once the rest of the code is properly documented.

Hope you find this interesting!
